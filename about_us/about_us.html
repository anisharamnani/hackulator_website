Avi later saw that students in under resourced schools did not have access to graphing calculators; they were locked up and only available for short segments of classroom time.

She feels too many students are overwhelmed by the fact that math builds on previously learned material over the years and doesn't want it to be that way. She is going to make sure this calculator helps people be less scared of math. </td>
