Not us. You even hear those feel good stories of college roommates, and best friends who started a company together.  Not us either.</p><p>We came together because we believed what we could do with Apptopia would represent a shift in how people perceive mobile apps.  See, apps are not just products that you buy for $0.99; they are complete businesses with revenues, customers, technology, and partners.  A mobile app is an asset.</p><p>Apptopia is the marketplace that will broker the sale of these apps.  We will manage the entire process through to completion.  Starting with recommending app valuation & connecting sellers with buyers.  Concluding with escrow services, code review, and interfacing with Apple & Google on your behalf until the deal is done.</p><hr /><div class="row-fluid bio-main"><div class="span5"><img alt="Eliran Sapir" src="https://apptopia-production.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/avatars/eliran-sapir-dcad445dfc11bb6361cd8b454752599c.png" /><div class="details"><h4>Eliran Sapir</h4><h5>Founder & CEO</h5><a href="mailto:Eli@apptopia.com">Eli@apptopia.com</a><div class="social small"><p class="note-follow">Follow me!</p><ul><li><a class="social-twitter" href="http://twitter.com/eliransapir" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a></li><li><a class="social-linkedin" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/eliransapir" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="span7"><p>Eli drives Apptopia’s overall strategic vision while overseeing all facets of the company’s operations.
